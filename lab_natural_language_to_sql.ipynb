        "The structure and clarity of the prompt had a direct impact on the correctness of the generated SQL.\n",

        "\n",
        "Some prompt variations produced incorrect or unreliable outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "• When the question was too vague, the model sometimes:\n",
        "  - Assumed relationships that were not explicitly defined\n",
        "  - Used fields that were not present in the schema\n",
        "  - Confused tables that had similar purposes\n",
        "\n",
        "• In more complex questions, the model occasionally:\n",
        "  - Missed necessary JOIN conditions\n",
        "  - Used incorrect grouping logic\n",
        "  - Selected columns unrelated to the requested metric\n",
        "\n",
        "• When the prompt wording introduced ambiguity (for example linking education and salary indirectly), the model sometimes:\n",
        "  - Focused on the wrong table\n",
        "  - Generated logically valid SQL that did not actually answer the question\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "• Use of non-existing columns  \n",
        "• Incorrect aggregation logic (missing GROUP BY)  \n",

        "- The prompt did not clearly specify what needed to be compared\n",

        "The following helped generate better SQL:\n",
        "\n",
        "• Clear schema visibility  \n",
        "• Direct and simple question phrasing  \n",

        "---\n",

        "### What I learned\n",
        "\n",
        "• Prompt clarity strongly affects SQL accuracy  \n",
        "• Models tend to infer missing structure when instructions are ambiguous  \n",
        "• Explicit goals reduce hallucination  \n",
